Here are documentation samples that I have created using different tools and editors to demonstrate familiarity of working with them.   
Some documents are re-created from my earlier work after redacting and re-editing proprietory content.   

## Documentation Samples 
[Sample Feature Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marie13-test/user-assistance-marie/main/USB_Feature_Doc.pdf)   
This is a feature document that explains the concept, architecture of the system, requirements and implementation details of the new feature.   
It is for use of developers, testers, architects and product owners.   
It is a PDF document written in the **DITA** model using **OxygenXML Editor**.   


[Sample API Documentation](https://github.com/marie13-test/user-assistance-marie/wiki/Sample-API-reference-and-user-manuals)   
They describe component API C-functions for use by developers and integrators of the interfacing components.   
The Reference Manual details the syntax, parameters, return values and specific actions performed by the APIs.   
The User Manual describes the overall functionality and usage of the APIs.   
It is documented in **GitHub Wiki** using **Markdown**.
